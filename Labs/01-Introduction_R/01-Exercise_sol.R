#' ## Exercise 1: Fill in the answers below.

#' It is useful to note that you could make your comment into texts on the knitted document by using `#'` instead of `#`. Notice the difference in appearance between putting `#` and `#'` on the knitted document.

# 1. Create an object called `name` with your name as value.


# 2. Create an object called `a` and assign value 1.


# 3. Create an object called `b` and assign value 2.


# 4. Return a + b


# 5. Return a - b


# 6. Return a*b


# 7. return a/b


# 8. Install and load `tidyverse` package. Please make sure you execute install.packages("name of the package") on your console instead of putting it down on R script. If you put it on your R script, it'll throw out an error when you try to knit it.




#' Submit the knitted html document on Canvas. You could click `File`>`Knit Document` or simply use shortcut, `Ctrl` `Shift` `K` to knit the Rmarkdown or R scripts. You may able to see the knitted document in the same folder that this .Rmd file is located (If you've downloaded the file directly from Canvas, the .Rmd may be located in `Downloads` folder by default and thus you may want to look for the knitted document there).
