#' This is the recap of the lab material.
#' We continue to use `EAWE01` dataset to do the regressions. Necessary packages are already loaded as follows:
#'
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, readr, huxtable, broom)

#'
#' 1. Read in the data and call it `wages`
# wages <- read_csv('___________')

#' 2. Regress `EARNINGS` on `FEMALE`.
# lm(_____ ~ ______, data = wages)

#' 3. Interpret the results especially the coefficient estimate of `FEMALE` in your own words.


#' 4. Regress `log(EARNINGS)` on `S`, `EXP`, `FEMALE` and `S*FEMALE`

#' 5. Interpret the results especially the coefficient estimate of `FEMALE:S` in your own words.
