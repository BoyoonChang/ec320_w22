# ec320 Introduction to Econometrics

## Overview
### What are we doing here?
- We are economists. 
- We care about causality
  - If X truely caused Y
  - If there are any other confouding factors that may have biased our inference


### What is **econometrics**?
- It's a tool to infer the truth from the information that we have
- Truth is never seen. The best thing that we can do is to make a well-informed inference. We want our inference to be very similar to the truth. That's where **econometrics** comes in. 
- The goal is to make the inference that we have from the sample be as close to the truth. 
- You might ask, you are making an assumption that we know what the truth is, and that we can determine whether our inference is true or false. 
- Even though we don't know what the truth is, we can engage in data generating process (DGP) and set arbitrary true model then test how good the models in prediction or how unbiased/consistent estimators are in making causal inference.


So welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We are about to embark a great journey.
