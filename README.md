# Introduction to Econometrics

Welcome to EC 320: Introduction to Econometrics (Winter 2021) at the University of Oregon.

This course introduces the statistical techniques that help economists learn about the world using data. Using calculus and introductory statistics, students will cultivate a working understanding of the theory underpinning regression analysis&mdash;*how* it works, *why* it works, and *when it can lead us astray*. As the course progresses, students will apply the insights of theory to work with and learn from actual data using `R`, a statistical programming language. My goal is for students to leave the course with marketable skills in data analysis and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;a more sophisticated understanding of the notion that correlation does not necessarily imply causation.
