# Regression Logic

---
# Regression

Economists often rely on (linear) regression for statistical comparisons.

- *"Linear"* is more flexible than you think.

Regression analysis helps us make *other things equal* comparisons.

- We can model the effect of $X$ on $Y$ while .hi[controlling] .pink[for potential confounders].
- Forces us to be explicit about the potential sources of selection bias.
- Failure to control for confounding variables leads to .hi[omitted-variable bias], a close cousin of selection bias

# Returns to Private College

**Research Question:** Does going to a private college instead of a public college increase future earnings?

- **Outcome variable:** earnings
- **Treatment variable:** going to a private college (binary)

--

**Q:** How might a private school education increase earnings?

--

**Q:** Does a comparison of the average earnings of private college graduates with those of public school graduates .pink[isolate the economic returns to private college education]? Why or why not?

---
# Returns to Private College

**How might we estimate the causal effect of private college on earnings?**

**Approach 1:** Compare average earnings of private college graduates with those of public college graduates.

- Prone to selection bias.

**Approach 2:** Use a matching estimator that compares the earnings of individuals the same admissions profiles.

- Cleaner comparison than a simple difference-in-means.
- Somewhat difficult to implement.
- Throws away data (inefficient).

**Approach 3:** Estimate a regression that compares the earnings of individuals with the same admissions profiles.

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Difference-in-Means, Take 2 -->

<!-- ## Example: Returns to private college -->

<!-- show same data with groupings based on application profile; what are the differences/similarities within/across groups?; calculate within-group diff-in-means; take average of these (unweighted, then weighted); show and discuss causal diagram -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Difference-in-Means, Regression style -->

<!-- ## Example: Returns to private college -->

<!-- write pop model, describe coefficients and regression lingo; hand wave about OLS and estimated pop model; run regression of example data -->

# The Regression Model

We can estimate the effect of $X$ on $Y$ by estimating a .hi[regression model]:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i$$

- $Y_i$ is the outcome variable.

--

- $X_i$ is the treatment variable (continuous).

--

- $u_i$ is an error term that includes all other (omitted) factors affecting $Y_i$.

--

- $\beta_0$ is the **intercept** parameter.

--

- $\beta_1$ is the **slope** parameter.

---
# Running Regressions

The intercept and slope are population parameters.

Using an estimator with data on $X_i$ and $Y_i$, we can estimate a .hi[fitted regression line]:

$$\hat{Y_i} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i$$

- $\hat{Y_i}$ is the **fitted value** of $Y_i$.

- $\hat{\beta}_0$ is the **estimated intercept**.

- $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the **estimated slope**.

--

The estimation procedure produces misses called .hi[residuals], defined as $Y_i - \hat{Y_i}$.

---
# Running Regressions

In practice, we estimate the regression coefficients using an estimator called .hi[Ordinary Least Squares] (OLS).

- Picks estimates that make $\hat{Y_i}$ as close as possible to $Y_i$ given the information we have on $X$ and $Y$.
 
- We will dive into the weeds after the midterm.

---
# Running Regressions

OLS picks $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ that trace out the line of best fit. Ideally, we wound like to interpret the slope of the line as the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$.

```{r, cache = T, include = F}
df <- data.frame(W = as.integer((1:200>100))) %>%
  mutate(X = .5+2*W + rnorm(200)) %>%
  mutate(Y = -.5*X + 4*W + 1 + rnorm(200),time="1") %>%
  group_by(W) %>%
  mutate(mean_X=mean(X),mean_Y=mean(Y)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r, dev = "svg", echo = F, fig.height = 5.5}
ggplot(data = df, aes(y = Y, x = X)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, color = "#9370DB") +
  theme_simple
```

---
# Confounders

However, the data are grouped by a third variable $W$. How would omitting $W$ from the regression model affect the slope estimator?

```{r, dev = "svg", echo = F, fig.height = 5.5}
ggplot(data = df, aes(y = Y, x = X, color = as.factor(W))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_gif + 
  labs(color = "W") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkslategrey", red_pink))
```

---
# Confounders

The problem with $W$ is that it affects both $Y$ and $X$. Without adjusting for $W$, we cannot isolate the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$.

```{r, dev = "svg", echo = F, fig.height = 5.5}
dag1 <- dagify(Y ~ X + W,
               X ~ W,
               exposure = "X",
               outcome = "Y")

ggplot(data = dag1, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
      geom_dag_point(color = red_pink) +
      geom_dag_edges() +
      geom_dag_text(family = "Fira Sans") +
      theme_dag()
```

---
# Controlling for Confounders

We can control for $W$ by specifying it in the regression model:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 W_i + u_i$$

- $W_i$ is a **control variable**.

- By including $W_i$ in the regression, we can use OLS can difference out the confounding effect of $W$.

- **Note:** OLS doesn't care whether a right-hand side variable is a treatment or control variable, but we do.

# Omitted-Variable Bias

The presence of omitted-variable bias (OVB) precludes causal interpretation of our slope estimates.

We can back out the sign and magnitude of OVB by subtracting the .pink[slope estimate from a ***long*** regression] from the .purple[slope estimate from a ***short*** regression]:

$$\text{OVB} = \color{#9370DB}{\hat{\beta}_1^{\text{Short}}} - \color{#e64173}{\hat{\beta}_1^{\text{Long}}}$$
